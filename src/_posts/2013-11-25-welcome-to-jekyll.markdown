#Say hello to Jekyll and OpenShift :)

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% note danger, jQuery required %}
  Please note that <strong>all JavaScript plugins require jQuery</strong> to be included, as shown in the <a href="#template">starter template</a>. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.0.2/bower.json">Consult our <code>bower.json</code></a> to see which versions of jQuery are supported.
{% endnote %}
